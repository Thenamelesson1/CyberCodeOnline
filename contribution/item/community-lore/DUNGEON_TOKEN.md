you find this dirty old coin after you open a box as your looking at it you can make out the word token on the coin you think about the coin you call an old friend who loved stuff like this you tell him about how you found the coin and you start to ask him what is it and why was it in a box he tells you that every one calls them dungeon tokens and that people tend to use them in dungeons as a sort of tradin system in the dungeons but other than that they don't really have any value your friend hangs up and leaves you there to wonder why was it in a box
